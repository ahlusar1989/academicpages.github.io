Greetings and welcome!
======
Briefly, I was a biomedical scientist and educator serving the District of Columbia and Montgomery County. Later, after several years working as a software engineer, data scientist, machine learning researcher, I am now serving as a researcher within the Advanced Security Initiatives Group within Cisco Security and Trust Orrganization. Here I have had the pleasure on - amongst others: 

1. Developing Bayesian estimation for anomaly deteection and fraud and changepoint detection in time series
2. Builing and evaluating deeep learning NLP models for customized search and classification
3. Formulating and implementing propensity scoring method and matching heuristics in order to capture average treatment effects from different treatement regimens 
4. Developing mixed effects models in order to account for missing data and variability in data collection
5. Applying survival analysis in order to predict when user engagement declines
6. Applying distributed computing and data parallelism to device telemtry in order to detect anomaliesss

Herein you will find a shortlist of research projects, publications, talks and my resume.
