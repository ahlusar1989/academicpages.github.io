Education
======
* B.S. in Neuroscience and Anthropology, University of Michigan, 2011
* Postgraduate Studies - Economics, Harvard Business School, 2015
* MSc. Statistics and Applied Mathematics, North Carolina State University, expected (2021)

Work experience
======
* May 2019 - Present: Data Scientist
  * Cisco Systems Incorporated - Security and Trust Organization
  * Achievements:
    1. Spearheaded new statistical learning apporach for identifying counterfeit in telemetry data 
    2. Submitted new patent for anomaly detection in defect-tracking systems for development artifacts
    3. Implemented POC novel deep learning bi-LSTM archiecture for search and classification of forensic evidence
    4. Created ARIMA, SARIMA and AR models for extreme-event forecasting of revenue
    5. Applied survival analysis estimation for user engagement studies for compliance training
    6. Presented work to executive leadership and liased with stakeholders for continual feedback
  * Supervisor: Mr. Joe Gipson and Mr. Jeff Schutt

* Fall 2019: Research Assistant
  * North Carolina State University
  * Achievements:
    1. Developed online-training and batch experiementation architecture for transfer learning
    2. Worked on theoretical derivation of function approximation derivation for off-policy exploration
  * Supervisor: Dr. Eric Laber, Department of Statistics

* Spring 2019: Research Assistant
  * North Carolina State University
  * Achievements:
    1. Implemented Asynchronous Actor Critic Models (A3C) for NFL football and NBA basketball
    2. Formulated and published research report comparing approaches - including Dueling DQN Prioritized Replay - within the context of first-player shooter games
    3. Researched, replicated and extended MDP and Finite Horizon Reinforcement Learning models for spatial decision making
  * Supervisor: Dr. Eric Laber, Department of Statistics

* Summer 2018, Automation Engineering Intern
  * Compozed Labs, Allstate
  * Achievements:
    1. Created novel RNN speech generation language model to be integrated into RoadSide Service
    2. Architected and implemented a proof-of-concept event-driven microservice, written in Golang, that leverages RabbitMQ as a broker and Redis as a persistent backend. Built additional configuration for client to also accommodate Amazon SQS and Memcache as a job queue. 
    3. Developed custom API schema validator package in order to prevent invalid response and requests to be received from third-party vendor applications. The impetus for this features was to adapt to the lack of a consumer-driven contract implementation.
    4. Created and presented a workshop on advanced functional Java concepts for machine learning
