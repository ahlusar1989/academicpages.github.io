Joke Generation Neural Network

Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN, LSTM) for character-level language models in Python (Tensorflow) and modified to work with JavaScript (deeplearn.js, ML5.js)

Inspired by:

1. [Sherjil Ozair's Char-RNN](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow)
2. [ml5js example](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library/tree/master/training/lstm)
