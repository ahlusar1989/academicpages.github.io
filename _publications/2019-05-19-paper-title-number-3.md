excerpt: 'There are two main approaches to reinforcement learning: value based methods
that aim to find an optimal Q-function, and policy based ones that directly look
for the optimal policy. However most of reinforcement learning problems (such as
learning to play games) have large or even continuous states spaces, which makes
constructing Q-values table impossible. Thus, there is a need for approximate
reinforcement learning.
In this paper the Deep reinforcement learning methods weâ€™ve used to train an agent
to play in a Doom environment.'
