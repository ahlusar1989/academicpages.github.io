This paper was prepared after exploratory work in telephony studies of open-sourced feedback and complaints from victims of robocalls and of predatory phishing scams.

In this paper, we are the first to apply an unsupervised retrieval technique to crowd-sourced data (COC) in or- der to describe the authenticity of phone numbers. We considered over 100,000 complaints collected via crowd- sourced efforts (e.g., 800notes.com). Overall, our results show that the proposed generative probabilistic model produces topics that are quantitatively and qualitatively better than matrix decomposition techniques, such as La- tent Semantic Analysis (LSA). In this paper, we propose this model as a more efficacious mechanism for authen- ticating phone numbers. The proposed model identifies malicious phone-numbers adaptively. Additionally, the model labels and ranks numbers by their re-use across different scam campaigns. This last insight, in particular, possesses implications for research combating phishing attacks, account fraud and identity theft.
