Within large enterprises disparate unstructured data sources contain valuable information that needs to be unified with other instrumentation in order to fulfill business objectives. In this talk, we present a deep learning implementation, using bidirectional - LSTMs that enabled Cisco S&TO to enable search for forensic evidence evaluation and unification. Our solution enabled Cisco to streamline processes for service request triaging - reducing time to address customer reqeusts.
