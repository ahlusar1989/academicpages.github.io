Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery that affects millions of people. Escort websites are a primary vehicle for selling the services of trafficking victims.

We present a statistical model that discriminates between trafficking victims and independent providers. The proposed model exhibits better predictive accuracy than competing methods. We also created a suite of interactive data visualization and exploration tools to identify potential victims and to inform intervention strategies.
