Recently, I am experimenting with different mechanisms for deriving decision functions for multiclass classification problems. I have spent some time reading and experiementing with examples from the following references:


1. Marti A. Hearst. 1998. Support Vector Machines. IEEE Intelligent Systems 13, 4 (July 1998), 18â€“28. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1109/5254.708428
2. James, Gareth & Witten, Daniela & Hastie, Trevor & Tibshirani, Robert. (2013). An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R. 

In light of this, I have contrived a few illustrative examples and derivations in thiw writeup:
