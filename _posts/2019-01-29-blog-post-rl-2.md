I am currently reading Sutton and Barto (reference below). Along the way I decided to recreate certain experiments cited in each book chapter. This particular example includes the example from Figure 6.2.

I have added a notebook of the experiments:

[Temporal Difference Learning with Batch Updates](https://github.com/ahlusar1989/CS234ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/notebooks/Chapter%206%20TD(0)%20-%20Random%20Walk%20Example%20(Figure%206.2%20Experiment%20Replication).ipynb)

Plots are [here](https://github.com/ahlusar1989/CS234ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/notebooks/images/example_6_2.png).
