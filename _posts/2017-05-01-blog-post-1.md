Just wrapped up my second semester of post-graduate studies in mathematics and statistics. I decided to take a graduate network security course. My capstone research project was within the field of telephony. You can find the paper included in the publications section. In retrospect, I could have submitted this to a security conference, but, at the time, I also got swept up in a couple of other projects with Dr. Laber. In the end, I missed the opportunity to submit this paper to NDSS, CCS and other highly prestigious security conferences. This was certainly a learning experience in finding out what works for you and making sure you can do one thing well and execute it to its fullest extent. However, I learned much about academic writing, writing for a security-research audience and how to structure your argumentation to make sure your paper is contributing to a body of work.
