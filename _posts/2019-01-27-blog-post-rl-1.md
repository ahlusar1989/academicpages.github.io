I am currently reading Sutton and Barto (reference below). Along the way I decided to recreate certain experiments cited in each book chapter. This particular example includes the Blackjack problem definition in Example 5.1. Along with it is a visual with varying numbers of steps taken.

I have added a notebook of the experiement:s
